# Malicious and Benign Websites

## Introduction
In this project, I'll be trying to classify website URLs as malicious or benign webistes based on application layer and network characteristics. Then I'll be trying to predict if a given URL is malicious or benign based on the models developed in the previous phase.

The input data is obtained here.

Before building prediction models and testing their predictive performance, I'll be conducting data exploration on the dataset to have a close look at its content.

Data exploration is done in Python 3 on Jupyter.
